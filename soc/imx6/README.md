Introduction
============

TamaGo is a framework that enables compilation and execution of unencumbered Go
applications on bare metal ARM System-on-Chip (SoC) components.

The [imx6](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago/tree/master/soc/imx6) package
provides support for NXP i.MX 6 series of System-on-Chip (SoCs) parts.

Documentation
=============

For TamaGo see its [repository](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago) and
[project wiki](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago/wiki) for information.

The package API documentation can be found on
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago).
