Introduction
============

TamaGo is a framework that enables compilation and execution of unencumbered Go
applications on bare metal ARM System-on-Chip (SoC) components.

The projects spawns from the desire of reducing the attack surface of embedded
systems firmware by removing any runtime dependency on C code and Operating
Systems.

The TamaGo framework consists of the following components:

 - A modified [Go distribution](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go)
   which extends `GOOS` support to the `tamago` target, allowing bare metal
   execution.

 - Go packages for SoC driver support.

 - Go packages for board support.

The modifications are meant to be minimal for both the Go distribution (< ~4000
LOC changed) and the target application (one import required), with a clean
separation from other architectures.

Strong emphasis is placed on code re-use from existing architectures already
included within the standard Go runtime, see
[Internals](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago/wiki/Internals).

Both aspects are motivated by the desire of providing a framework that allows
secure Go firmware development on embedded systems.

Current release level
=====================

The current release for the [TamaGo modified Go distribution](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go) is
[tamago1.15.2](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go/tree/tamago1.15.2),
which [adds](https://github.com/golang/go/compare/go1.15.2...f-secure-foundry:tamago1.15.2)
`GOOS=tamago` support to go1.15.2.

Binary releases for amd64 and armv7l Linux hosts [are available](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go/releases/latest).

Documentation
=============

The main documentation can be found on the
[project wiki](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago/wiki).

The package API documentation can be found on
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago).

Compiling
=========

Go applications are simply required to import, the relevant board package to
ensure that hardware initialization and runtime support takes place:

```golang
import (
	// Example for USB armory Mk II
	_ "github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago/board/f-secure/usbarmory/mark-two"
)
```

Build the [TamaGo compiler](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go)
(or use the [latest binary release](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go/releases/latest)):

```
git clone https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go -b latest
cd tamago-go/src && ./all.bash
cd ../bin && export TAMAGO=`pwd`/go
```

Go applications can be compiled with the compiler built in the previous step,
with the addition of a few flags/variables:

```
# Example for USB armory Mk II
GO_EXTLINK_ENABLED=0 CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=tamago GOARM=7 GOARCH=arm \
  ${TAMAGO} build -ldflags "-T 0x80010000  -E _rt0_arm_tamago -R 0x1000"
```

See the respective board package README file for compilation information for
each specific target.

Executing and debugging
=======================

See the respective board package README file for execution and debugging
information for each specific target (real or emulated).

The [example application](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-example)
provides sample driver usage and instructions for native as well as emulated
execution.
